# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Anonomi takes security and privacy seriously.

If you discover a **security or privacy vulnerability**, please report it **responsibly and privately**.

### Do NOT
- Do **not** open a public GitHub issue
- Do **not** discuss the issue publicly (issues, PRs, forums, social media)
- Do **not** test exploits against users or production infrastructure

### How to report

Please report vulnerabilities via email:

**anonomi@protonmail.com**

- You may use PGP if needed
- You do not need a GitHub account
- Anonymous reports are accepted

Provide enough detail to allow us to:
- Understand the issue
- Reproduce it safely
- Assess impact and scope

If available, include:
- Affected component or repository
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any mitigations you are aware of

---

## Scope

This security policy applies to:
- All Anonomi applications
- Services, tooling, and infrastructure code
- Protocol design and implementation
- Documentation errors that could lead to unsafe use

If you are unsure whether something is a security issue, **err on the side of reporting it privately**.

---

## Responsible Disclosure

We aim to:
- Acknowledge valid reports in a reasonable timeframe
- Work toward a fix before public disclosure
- Credit reporters when appropriate (if desired)

Please allow time for investigation and remediation before any public discussion.

---

## Philosophy

Anonomi is designed for users who may operate under **adversarial conditions**.

Security decisions prioritize:
- User safety over convenience
- Minimal metadata exposure
- Defensive design over growth
- Transparency without compromising users

We appreciate responsible research that respects these principles.

Thank you for helping keep Anonomi safe.
